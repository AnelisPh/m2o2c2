  The fourth week introduces multilinear algebra.
\end{abstract}

During this fourth week, we'll be be learning about bilinear maps.  These are important to us because, just like the derivative
of a function at a point is a linear map, the \textbf{second} derivative of a function at a point is a bilinear map.

After you finish all of Week 4, please be sure that you complete the
end of week quiz on Coursera.
