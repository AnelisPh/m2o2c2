\begin{abstract}
  The final week addresses higher order derivatives and taylors theorem
\end{abstract}

During this sixth and final week, we will learn how the $k^{th}$
derivative of a function at a point is a $k-$linear map.  We will then
formulate the full multivariable taylors theorem.

After you finish all of Week 6, please be sure that you complete the
End of Week 6 quiz.  This week, there are only a few questions, and
the theorems do not include proofs.  Consider this week more as an
impression of how to generalize what we did with the second derivative
to higher derivatives.

It has been a blast writing this course.  I hope you have been getting
a lot out of it.  Keep on rocking!
