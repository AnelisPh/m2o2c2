\begin{abstract}
  The final week addresses higher order derivatives and taylors theorem
\end{abstract}

During this sixth and final week, we will learn how the $k^{th}$ derivative of a function at
a point is a $k-$ linear map.  We will then formulate the full multivariable taylors theorem.

After you finish all of Week 6, please be sure that you complete the
final exam.

This week does not have as much content as the other weeks to give you time to concentrate on the final.  There are only a few questions,
and the theorems do not include proofs.  Consider this week more as an impression of how to generalize what we did with the second derivative
to higher derivatives.

It has been a blast writing this course.  I hope you have been getting a lot out of it.  Keep on rocking!
