  The final week addresses higher order derivatives and taylors theorem
\end{abstract}

During this sixth and final week, we will learn how the $k^{th}$ derivative of a function at
a point is a $k-$ linear map.  We will then formulate and prove the full multivariable taylors theorem.

After you finish all of Week 6, please be sure that you complete the
end of week quiz on Coursera.

It has been a blast writing this course.  I hope you have been getting a lot out of it.  Keep on rocking!
