\begin{abstract}
  The last week addresses higher-order derivatives and formulates Taylor's theorem.
\end{abstract}

During this sixth and final week, we will learn how the $k^{th}$
derivative of a function at a point is a $k-$linear map.  We will then
formulate a multivariable version of Taylor's theorem.

After you finish all of Week 6, please be sure that you complete the
End of Week 6 quiz.  Consider this week an invitation to consider how
to generalize what we did with the second derivative to higher
derivatives.

It has been a blast writing this course with you.  I hope you have
been getting a lot out of it.

Keep on rocking!
