  The fifth week introduces the second derivative
\end{abstract}

During this fifth week, we'll learn about the second derivative of a function at a point as a bilinear map.
We will use the second derivative to approximate functions to second order accuracy (Taylor's theorem), and apply this to 
optimization problems (The second derivative test).  On the same theme of optimization, we will also introduce Lagrange Multipliers.

After you finish all of Week 5, please be sure that you complete the
end of week quiz on Coursera.
