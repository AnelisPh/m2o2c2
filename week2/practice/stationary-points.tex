	\begin{question}
		Let $f:\R^2 \to \R^2$ be defined by $f(x,y) = (x^2-x-y^2,2xy-y) $.
		There is one stationary point of $f$ (one place where the derivative vanishes).  
		What is this stationary point?  Give your answer as a column vector
		 
		 \begin{matrix-answer}
		 correctMatrix = [['1/2'],['0']]

	\begin{question}
		Let $f:\R^3 \to \R$ be defined by $f(x,y,z) = x^2+xy+xz+z^2 $.
		There is one stationary point of $f$ (one place where the derivative vanishes).  
		What is this stationary point?  Give your answer as a column vector
