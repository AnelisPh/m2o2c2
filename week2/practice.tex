  Practice doing computations.

This section just contains practice problems on the material we have
learned this week. These problems do not have detailed hints:
\textbf{clicking on the hint will immediately reveal the answer}. Use
them to test your knowledge.

If you are confused about how to do any of these problems, ask your
peers in one of the forums.
