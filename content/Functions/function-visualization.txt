\\This should be an interactive demo page which gives a lot of different ways to visualize functions.  

\\Each domain/codomain choice should come with an interesting function already being plotted, but the user should be able to input any function they like.

"Play around with these different visualizations of functions from $\R^n \to \R^m$.  We only attempt to visualize such functions when $n$ and $m$ are $3$ or less.
Above that, you can still deal with these functions symbolically, but it becomes really hard to visualize them."
Domain: drop down R^1 to R^3, codomain: drop down R^1 \to R^3 Mode:  drop down depending on domain/codomain choices.

\\Each option has an explanation of how the function is being visualized.

1-->1:  
	parameterized particle:  move particle on domain line, other particle moves on codomain line
	graph: regular graph of function.  Movable point on domain, and graph
  -->2:
 	parameterized particle on image curve
  -->3: parameterized particle on image curve
  
2-->1:
	graph:  3d graph of function.
	Moving point:  move point in domain plane, see movement of point in codomain line
	contour plot: give a contour map.  Allow change in increment between contour lines.  Move point in codomain to see a differently colored contour line move in domain.
  -->2:
  	vector field: might be a bit messy though
  	moving point in domain and codomain plane
  	distorted lattice:  paint a lattice on the domain, see where that lattice ends up in the codomain
    phase plot:  color codomain with ROYGBIV phase and BW magnitude, color domain by pulling back color
  -->3: 
  	parameterized surface with moving point

3 -->1:
	Moving point
	contour plot
	colored balls at lattice points, given coloring on codomain line
  -->2:
  	moving point 
  	vector field <f,g,0>
  -->3:
  	moving point
  	vector field
  	distorted lattice
