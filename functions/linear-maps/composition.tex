\begin{abstract}
  The composition of linear maps can be computed with matrices.
\end{abstract}

\begin{question}
  Prove that if $S:\R^n \to \R^m$ is a linear map, and $T:\R^m \to \R^k$ is a linear map, then the composite function $T\circ S:\R^n \to R^k$ is also linear.

\end{question}
	
\begin{question}
  If the matrix of $S$ is $M_S = BLAH$ and the matrix of $T$ is $M_T = BLAH$, find the matrix of $T \circ S$.
\end{question}
	
\begin{definition}
  If $M$ is a $m\times n$ matrix and $N$ is a $k \times m$ matrix, then the \textit{product} $NM$ of the matrices is
  defined as the matrix of the composition of the linear maps defined by $M$ and $N$.  In other words  $MN$ is the matrix of 
  $L_M\ circ L_N$.
\end{definition}

\begin{warning}
  You may have seen another definition for matrix multiplication in
  the past.  That definition could be seen as a shortcut for how to
  compute the product, but it is usually presented devoid of
  mathematical meaning.  Hopefully our definition seems properly
  motivated: matrix multiplication is just what you do to compose
  linear maps.  We suggest working out the problems here using our
  definition: you will develop your own efficient shortcuts in time.
\end{warning}

\begin{question}
  If $M = BLAH$ and $N=BLAH$, compute $NM$.
\end{question}
	
Note:  it may be easier to think about the following questions if you think about linear maps first, and convert everything over to matrices after.

\begin{question}
  Find $2\times 2$ matrices $A$ and $B$ with $AB \neq BA$.
\end{question}
	
\begin{question}
  Find $A \neq 0$  with $AA = 0$.
\end{question}
	
\begin{question}
  If $A = BLAH$, find $v \neq 0$ with $Av = 0$ 
\end{question}
	
\begin{question}
  If $A = BLAH$, find $v$ with $Av = BLAH$ 
\end{question}
	
In the last two exercises, you found that solving matrix equations is equivalent to solving systems of linear equations.

\begin{question}
  Rewrite  $System of linear equations$ as $matrix equation$.
\end{question}
