steve: Welcome to M2O2C2
jim: in this course, there's no textbook
steve: and not too many of these videos
jim: we firmly believe that people learn math not by watching math, and not even by reading math, 
steve: people learn but by doing math
jim: and so this course is mostly built around questions
steve: and like everything we do, this is an experiment
jim: but we're glad you're here, and we hope you'll provide us with feedback about what's working well and what isn't working so well
