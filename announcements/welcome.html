Today is day one of <a href="https://class.coursera.org/m2o2c2-001/wiki/view?page=week1">M2O2C2: massively multivariable open online calculus course</a>.  You can jump into the math by <a href="https://class.coursera.org/m2o2c2-001/wiki/view?page=week1">clicking here</a>.

We are <a href="https://class.coursera.org/m2o2c2-001/wiki/view?page=AboutTheInstructor">Jim Fowler and Steve Gubkin</a>, and we are very glad that you are joining us for M2O2C2.  Please complete the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/m2o2c2-001/quiz/attempt?quiz_id=21">initial course survey</a>; your feedback will help me to customize the course.  And please <a href="/m2o2c2-001/forum/thread?thread_id=1">introduce yourself in the forum</a>.  We are looking forward to getting to know you.

There are sure to be some bumps along the way, but we are excited to have you in this experimental and experiential course.  M2O2C2 is a massive open course, and we really do mean <em>open</em>: you can find everything we used to build the course <a href="https://github.com/kisonecat/m2o2c2">in the GitHub repository</a> if you want to glance behind the scenes.  Each activity includes the source code we used to build it.  If you're comfortable with TeX and GitHub, we encourage you to contribute to the course materials by sending us <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull requests</a>.  Our dream is that M2O2C2 would become a massive open online <em>community</em> where everyone is both a student and a teacher.

totally looking forward to our time together,
~jim and steve
